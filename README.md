# Ola Dashboard Project

This project is an end-to-end analysis of Ola ride data using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for data visualization. It provides insights into ride volume, booking patterns, customer and driver behaviors, and revenue trends.

## SQL Analysis

The following SQL queries were used to analyze the dataset:

1. **Retrieve all successful bookings**
2. **Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type**
3. **Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers**
4. **List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides**
5. **Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues**
6. **Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings**
7. **Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI**
8. **Find the average customer rating per vehicle type**
9. **Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully**
10. **List all incomplete rides along with the reason**

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard visualizes the data to answer key business questions and uncover insights. The following visualizations were created:

1. **Ride Volume Over Time**: Tracks the number of rides completed over time.
2. **Booking Status Breakdown**: Displays the distribution of successful, cancelled, and incomplete bookings.
3. **Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance**: Highlights the most popular vehicle types based on ride distance.
4. **Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type**: Shows the average ratings customers give for different vehicle types.
5. **Cancelled Rides Reasons**: Analyzes the reasons for ride cancellations by customers and drivers.
6. **Revenue by Payment Method**: Visualizes the distribution of revenue based on payment methods like UPI, card, or cash.
7. **Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value**: Lists the highest-spending customers.
8. **Ride Distance Distribution Per Day**: Analyzes ride distances for each day.
9. **Driver Ratings Distribution**: Shows how drivers are rated by customers.
10. **Customer vs. Driver Ratings**: Compares customer and driver ratings across rides.
